<p><span class="smc">This</span> pamphlet is issued for the purpose of inducing
those who engage in this Great American Game
of “Draw Poker,” to play only for amusement and
pastime; and to expose those in our clubs and social
card parties who are tricky, or disposed to cheat.
Also to show to the American youth the dangers
that beset their path when playing this fascinating
game.</p>

<p>While we have treatises on this subject, by Blackbridge,
“American Hoyle,” “Schenck,” and others,—all
of whom teach the game, <em>with the rules and laws
that govern it</em>,—it has been left for “Uncle George,”
in a familiar, conversational manner, to “lay open”
and expose this game <em>as it is</em> too often played—with
its “lights and shadows,” its bright parts, and “ways
that are dark.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="ns">“</span><!-- no opening quote in original due to drop cap --><span class="uc">Rather</span> late, my boy, when I heard your
footsteps upon the stairs last evening,”
said Uncle George to his nephew, while sitting
at the breakfast-table on the morning of the
22d of February last.</p>

<p>“Yes, dear uncle, I acknowledge the corn.
‘I can not tell a lie,’ you know, on this the anniversary
of the birth of our Great Uncle
George, the Father of his Country, and especially
while his portrait on the wall is now
looking down upon me. The fact is, I accepted
an invitation to dine with a few friends at Delmonico’s
last evening, and after dinner a
<a name="png.08" id="png.08" href="#png.08"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>8<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>proposition was made to have ‘a little game of
draw’ for an hour or two; but the time passed
so rapidly, that I confess it was among the ‘wee
sma’ hours’ when we broke up. It was much
later than I intended to have played, I assure
you; but there seemed to be no time when all
were ready to quit.”</p>

<p>“I know! I know! my boy. It’s the same
‘old story.’ Those who are losers are playing
for ‘hunk,’ as they call it, and those who are
winners are too gentlemanly to quit and break
up the party. It was the same with your Uncle
George fifty years ago. I suppose you mean
‘Draw Poker,’ my boy?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, now; you know your Uncle George
is an old man, and, as the saying is, ‘has travelled’;
and having been a man of the world, has
seen much of the world’s <em>unwritten doings</em>.
Though you consider yourself <em>smart</em>—and I admit
you are fully up to the average of those of
your age,—yet you would be surprised at what
<a name="png.09" id="png.09" href="#png.09"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>9<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>I can tell you, of what is going on all about
you of which you know nothing. But as you
remind me that this is the 22d of February, and
a holiday, and as you have no business downtown
this morning, if you are willing to listen
to your uncle, he will gladly spend an hour in
talking to you about this game of ‘Draw
Poker,’ this ‘Great American Game,’ so called
on account of its origin and its devotees; for at
the present time it is indulged in by <em>all classes
in our country</em>—old and young, male and female,
rich and poor, church-goers and professional
gamblers; all classes, with ‘<i>antes</i>’ varying
from a penny to a hundred dollars or more.
Now, as a game for <em>recreation</em> and <em>pastime</em>, I do
not object to it; it is said to possess qualities
as an intellectual game, superior even to whist.
But when engaged in for the purpose of gambling,
I class it with other games in which professional
gamblers live and thrive, by cheating
and robbing those with whom they play. It
has been said there is no such thing as a
<a name="png.10" id="png.10" href="#png.10"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>10<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>‘<i>Square Gambler</i>’; and a well-known Wall
Street banker has said: ‘Whoever plays poker
will cheat.’ I can not agree with the latter, but,
with my definition of a gambler, I fully agree
with the former. I define a gambler to be ‘one
who cheats in games of skill and hazard.’ I
know this definition is not in accordance with
that given by our lexicographers, but I know it
will be accepted by all who play at games for
amusement, and object to being called gamblers.</p>

<p>“In my talk with you this morning, I shall
take it for granted that you are acquainted with
the manner of playing the game, as it is played
at the present time; for you must know, it’s
not the game of poker your Uncle George
played, years ago, upon our Western waters. It
was then called ‘Bluff,’ and we knew nothing
of ‘Straights,’ ‘Straight Flushes,’ ‘Blazes,’
or ‘Jack Pots.’ The game was known simply
as ‘Bluff’ or ‘Straight Poker.’ The value of
the hands in order was ‘One Pair,’ ‘Two
Pair,’ ‘Triplets,’ ‘Flushes,’ ‘Fulls,’ and
<a name="png.11" id="png.11" href="#png.11"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>11<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>‘Four of a kind.’ Your hand was made on
the first deal; no discarding and drawing to fill
afterwards. I suppose, my boy, you are familiar
with the present game, with all its innovations.
All this you have learned from your
experience at the clubs and social card parties,
and from works of instruction. But what I
desire to impress upon your mind this morning
is:</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="First">“<i>First.</i>—</h3
><p>The fact that gamblers, according to
your Uncle George’s definition, are found in the
clubs and private card parties, all over our city
and country; respected as gentlemen, with
‘Honorable’ and high-sounding titles attached
to their names. And yet these men are cheating
you every time you play with them. A case
in point: I read in the <cite>Century</cite> a few days
ago, where a game was being played between
Col. Randolph Snaughter and Major-General
Brown, a brief extract of which I will give
you, in order to show you how even a Major-General
could stoop to employ the crookedest
<a name="png.12" id="png.12" href="#png.12"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>12<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>kind of aid to gain his ends. As far as my
memory serves me, it was in this wise:</p>
</div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="hangdbl">“‘The Major-General was a man of smooth and courtly phrase,</div>
<div>Who had most charming manners, and winning little ways.</div>
<div>The hands he held were wonderful,—beyond all sane <span class="nw">belief,—</span></div>
<div>As Colonel Randolph Snaughter found, to his exceeding grief:</div>
<div>For, though he play’d a dashing game, and did not want for pluck,</div>
<div>He stood no ‘kinder sorter’ chance against such awful luck.</div>
<div>He lost the money in his purse, he lost his watch and chain;</div>
<div>And then the cause of Brown’s good luck to Snaughter was made plain,</div>
<div>For while he held <em>three</em> aces, the General he held <em>four</em>,</div>
<div>And could, had he deemed proper, have held as many more.’”</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="plate">
<a name="png.13" id="png.13" href="#png.13"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]<br
 /></span></span></a><img src="images/i_b13-700.jpg" id="i_b13"

 />SEE <a href="#png.11">PAGE 11</a>.
</div>

<p>“I want to impress strongly upon you <em>the
fact</em> also, that the game of Draw Poker is an <em>expensive
recreation</em>. It’s only a question of time,
and means at your command, as to the amount
of money you will lose. The longer you play,
and the more means under your control, the
<a name="png.15" id="png.15" href="#png.15"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>15<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>more you will be out of pocket in the end.
Like the ‘Outside Public,’ in Wall Street, it is
only a question of time. At some other time,
my boy, I will talk to you about Wall Street,
but not now. With many, the loss of money
at Draw Poker is the smallest item. There are
those who become <em>infatuated</em>, and the result is
not only loss of money, but loss of time, character,
business, position in society, and often
ends in dissipation and crime. Let me warn
you, therefore, my boy, of the danger of becoming
too much attached to this game. When
you find you have neglected to perform some
duty, or to keep some business engagement, in
order to play; when you find yourself playing
into late hours, as you confess you did last night,
or when you find you are losing more than you
can well afford, with your salary, quit it!! quit
it!!! I say, don’t wait for all three of these
warnings, but quit it on the first show of either;
for you are then on dangerous ground. The
charm of the gaming snake is beginning to
<a name="png.16" id="png.16" href="#png.16"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>16<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>produce its effect, and your only safety is in throwing
off the influence of the charmer. Any
delay or procrastination <em>now is almost sure destruction</em>.
There is no game of chance or skill
that brings out one’s real nature, one’s ownself,
as much as Draw Poker. Where players all
stand well in a community, the game is expected
to be fair and honorable; hence a good opportunity
is offered for those who are <em>disposed to
cheat</em>, to do so. I would rather play a few
games of poker with one whose character and
disposition I would like to learn, than to receive
a basketful of recommendations. I admit there
are games played in which all are gentlemen,
and no one under any circumstance could be
induced to take any advantage of another. But,
my boy, such cases are rare. Want of opportunity,
and fear of the eyes of others, are what
keep many players honest. Now, with these
introductory remarks, I will say, that it is to
guard you against the acts of such players that
I shall talk to you for a short time, feeling sure
<a name="png.17" id="png.17" href="#png.17"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>that, if you remember well what I say, it will
be to your eventual great gain.</p>

<p>“I begin by repeating the advice of the father
to his son. Said he, ‘My son, if you play cards
for gain, you will surely lose in the end; but if
you will see that the <em>cards are cut</em> immediately
before dealing every time, your money will last
you longer.’ This was good advice, and just as
good now as when first given. There are card
players, or ‘card sharps,’ as they are called,
who can shuffle cards so adroitly as to ‘<i>put up
a hand</i>’ right before your eyes, and you not
know it. Even a ‘bungler’ can shuffle so as
to give himself a ‘pair,’ or at least to have
knowledge of what cards are left on the top or
bottom of the pack, which knowledge he can
make useful in many ways. For instance, after
the deal, he finds in looking at his hand that he
has a pair that match the card he knows is on
the bottom of the pack. In helping himself,
he takes this bottom card; he ‘does his work
so fine’ you can not discover the cheat. And
<a name="png.18" id="png.18" href="#png.18"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>if he has a ‘four straight,’ a ‘four flush’ or
‘two pairs,’ and the bottom card will fill his
hand, he takes it, as I have said, making his
‘straight,’ or ‘flush,’ or ‘full.’ Many other
points under this head could be given you, my
boy, why the cards should be cut the last thing
before being dealt. Strictly, the <em>blank card</em> of
the pack should always be the bottom card of
the pack being dealt.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Second">“<i>Second.</i>—</h3
><p>Whenever the cards are cut, be sure
and have the <em>two separated parts of the pack put
together</em> before dealing. An old gentleman
once said to a young man, ironically, who was
dealing from a part of the pack, ‘Young man,
you ought never to play cards until your hands
have grown sufficiently large to hold the whole
pack at one and the same time.’ The reason is
this: The party shuffling has a chance to know
what cards are on the top of the pack, and by
holding only the cut portion in his hand while
dealing, knows into whose hand these cards fall,
or if they should fall to himself, he would know
<a name="png.19" id="png.19" href="#png.19"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>how to discard, so as to have his hand helped
by drawing. You see this gives the dealer an
advantage over the other players.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Third">“<i>Third.</i>—</h3
><p>The pack, or any undealt portions
of it, should at all times remain in sight of the
players, and <em>upon the table</em>, and held by the
dealer only <em>while actually engaged in dealing or
in helping hands</em>. This is to prevent the dealer
from obtaining knowledge while holding the
cards on or below the surface of the table.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Fourth">“<i>Fourth.</i>—</h3
><p>In gathering up the discarded
cards for the purpose of shuffling, be sure that the
faces of the cards are turned from the shuffler;
for otherwise the party shuffling gains an advantage,
by knowing the position of some of the
higher cards, and besides, it gives him an opportunity
of ‘putting up the cards’ while shuffling.
In no instance, however, should the discarded
cards be gathered up while some are still engaged
in playing their hands.</p>
</div>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Fifth">“<i>Fifth.</i>—</h3

always give the number called for, <em>together</em>,
<a name="png.20" id="png.20" href="#png.20"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>as they come from the pack, and not <em>singly</em>, one
by one; for this reason: There are persons who
can with their finger-nails, or ring, or by a slight
bend, so mark the cards, as to know them whenever
these marks are seen; and in dealing they
can only see the marks by dealing the cards off
one at a time, and not together. And besides,
if the dealer deals them off <em>singly</em>, and knows
the bottom card, he can, as I have said, help
himself to that card, which he could not so well
do by dealing them off together. Again, some
dealers are so expert, that they can deal continually
the <em>second card</em> from the top of the
pack; they can give you any number called for,
<em>one at a time</em>, without disturbing the top card,
which top card the dealer, of course, wants himself,
to help his hand. This could not be done,
if the number called for were dealt off together,
and not one at a time. This is called, ‘<i>Dealing
Seconds</i>.’</p>

 </span></span></a>helped; they should be discarded to the person
whose duty is to gather them up for shuffling.</em>
By observing this direction, it will be found difficult
for a player to discard a different number
from the number he draws, without detection.
Any dealer who is ‘<i>Playing in</i>’ with another,
and helping his ‘Pard’ to extra cards, and receiving
the same number in discard, can avoid
detection by immediately gathering up the discarded
ones, and putting them on the bottom of
the pack from which he is dealing. I repeat,

Our playing cards are large print. A man nearly
blind can distinguish the cards, and ordinary

desiring more light is dealing with <em>marked

marks. I say, my boy, you must keep a sharp
look-out for all such players.</p>

of the party’s trying to take advantage,
and must be looked upon with suspicion. The

<h3 title="Tenth">“<i>Tenth.</i>—</h3

on the move, while they ought to be quiet
on, or above the table. The probabilities are
that such a player is taking cards from the pack,
and secreting them in some place on his person—inside
of his neck collar, under his handkerchief,
in his lap, up his coat-sleeve, or holding
them in the bend of his knee, and using them
whenever the hand dealt him can be benefited
thereby. At other times, two or three cards of
like denomination are held in the palm of the
hand, to be used with the next hand given, in
helping to make a very large hand. This is
done by many so cleverly that it is impossible to
see the cards so held. This is called ‘<i>Holding
out cards</i>.’</p>

<h3 title="Eleventh">“<i>Eleventh.</i>—</h3
><p>You have undoubtedly noticed,
my boy, hanging in the saloons of our River and
Sound steamers, a card on which is printed
these words: ‘Beware of well-dressed persons
who invite you to play euchre.’ Now these
well-dressed persons are known as travelling
<a name="png.26" id="png.26" href="#png.26"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>‘Card Sharps.’ They are always well dressed
when travelling, for their dress is their card of
introduction to their fellow-travellers. If you
should accept an invitation of one from these,
and sit down with two others to a game of
‘Euchre,’ or ‘All Fours,’ it will <em>always result</em>
in the cards being ‘put up’ at some stage of
the game, so as to have you receive a very large
<em>poker</em> hand, and one of the others a <em>larger</em> one.
Although professing to be entire strangers to
each other, the fact is, they belong to a gang,
who travel for the purpose of playing and robbing
others, as a business. The whole plan now
is to induce you to bet on your hand as a ‘<em>poker</em>
hand,’ which, in your verdancy, you would be
tempted to do, <em>but surely to lose if you did</em>.
Parties have often been taken in, in this way,
and been known to lose all the money they had
with them, together with their watches, and
other valuables about their persons. These fellows,
and their game, are becoming so well
known that they find it difficult to pick up a
<a name="png.27" id="png.27" href="#png.27"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>‘Greeny,’ or ‘Flat,’ or ‘Sucker,’ as they call
their victims. Your Uncle George was attacked
by one of these gangs once, while on the cars,
coming from Albany to this city. Knowing
their game, he allowed them to go on, until he
got the <em>large poker hand</em>, and their offering to
bet on theirs being a better one. Thinking it
had gone far enough, he looked at them all
squarely for a moment, and then said: ‘You
think you have got the best <em>poker hand</em>, do
you? Well, now; I give you just one minute
to “<em>git</em>,” all of you’; and they did ‘git,’ too.
While leaving, one grumbled out to another, in
an angry tone, ‘You must be a <span class="nw">d——d</span> fool to
take that man for a “Flat.”’ They all left the
train at the next station. I would have informed
the conductor, but it is said that some conductors
are afraid of these fellows, or, worse
yet, are ‘in with them,’ so I said nothing.”<!-- closing quote invisible in original --></p>

<p>“A friend of mine said to me one day:
‘Charlie, I have an intimate acquaintance in
Pine Street, who has a small back office, and
does a commission business on foreign account.
Though his commissions are heavy, yet he has
much spare time, and is very fond of playing
poker, although he knows nothing of the game.’
Said he, ‘This person thinks no more of losing
a thousand dollars than a dollar; and I have a
plan by which I know we can beat him sure, without
taking any risk.’ I’ll give you his plan, uncle,
in his own words. Said he to me, ‘I will stand
<em>behind</em>, and so as to see my friend’s hand, and will
telegraph you with my fingers, whether he has
one or two pair, triplets or better; and with
this knowledge of course you can beat him,
<em>sure</em>.’ His proposition and plan seemed somewhat
mixed to me, and besides, I didn’t like it;
so I excused myself, saying I had but little time
for playing the game, and when I did play it
<a name="png.31" id="png.31" href="#png.31"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>31<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>was only for recreation, with a made-up party of
friends, or at the club. But I have thought of
the proposition of my friend many times since,
and have wondered what it meant.”</p>

<p>“Well! my boy, I am delighted to know that
you had moral courage enough to refuse. It
was a gilt-edged temptation, and the thousands
who have taken in the bait will die with the
secret of their losses, and the way it was done,
remaining in their own breasts untold. A friend,
was he? May God deliver you, my boy, from all
such friends! This is an old trick. This friend
is your worst enemy. He is ‘in with’ this
‘Pine Street commission merchant,’ as he calls
him, and the plan is to <em>rob you</em>. This is the
way they do it. Back of where you sit at the
table, and so as to enable a confederate to look
through from an adjoining room and see your
hand of cards, is a small aperture in the wall or
ceiling, and by this means your hand is seen and
telegraphed, under the table, to your opponent,
<em>so perfectly</em>, that this ‘merchant on foreign
<a name="png.32" id="png.32" href="#png.32"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>32<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>account’ knows the exact value of your hand,
from one pair, up, and <em>down</em>, to any <em>card high</em>.</p>

<p>“Now, this advantage will invariably beat
you; for your friend, as you call him, telegraphs
you as to <i>one</i>, or <i>two pair</i>, <i>triplets</i>, etc., held by
your adversary; while his confederate in the adjoining
room telegraphs him the exact <em>size</em> of your
hand; even, as I have said, to the highest card,
when you held no pair. This robbery is carried
on quite largely in this and other cities; and
large amounts lost, without the fact ever being
told of; for the reason that the one who has
been taken in, and lost, must, if he attempts to
expose, acknowledge that he himself yielded to
the temptation to do wrong. Your friend’s
friendship is like that of the spider to the fly.
The Pine Street office is the parlor, and your
money is the fly, which walks in, but goes out
as yours, no more. I am very glad you have
mentioned this incident, and I know you will
not forget my explanation of it.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Twelfth">“<i>Twelfth.</i>—</h3
><p>I will now speak of the ‘Jack
<a name="png.33" id="png.33" href="#png.33"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>33<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>Pot.’ This is an innovation of a late date, and
is very much against the interests of a poor
player, or one who, for the time being, is in bad
luck; for it compels all alike to put into the
pot the amount of the ‘<i>ante</i>.’ Yet in a square
game it has its advantages; for if your bad luck
should turn to good, two or three hands would
bring back all of your losing, and make you
‘hunk.’ While playing ‘Jack Pots,’ you must
watch: <i>First</i>, those who are behind-time, and
have to be reminded that they have not ‘<i>put up</i>’;
and, <i>Second</i>, those who throw their chips into
the pot <em>indiscriminately</em>, or who occasionally
make the wrong change, or who are habitually
changing the chips in the pot with their own—large
ones for smaller, or <i>vice versa</i>—or who
are accustomed to say: ‘Well, I am in. I owe
so much to the pot.’ These are all wrong, and
done in many cases,—not in all, I am glad to
say,—for the purpose of <em>saving or making
wrongfully</em>, and deserve to be called ‘petty
thefts.’ The only right way, my boy, is for all
<a name="png.34" id="png.34" href="#png.34"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>34<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>who have an interest in the pot, to promptly
‘put up’ the full amount required in the centre
of the table, in front of themselves, and separate
from the pot; and under no circumstances allow
the chips in the pot to be handled. The dealer
should never commence to deal the cards until
the bets made are all in for the <em>full amount</em> and
<em>no more</em>,—having nothing due <em>from</em>, or <em>to</em>, the
pot. This regularity will save misunderstandings,
disputes, and oftentimes animosities between the
players.</p>
</div>

<p>“A quarter of a century or more ago, your
Uncle George cut a slip from <cite>The Spirit of the
Times</cite>, headed ‘Hints to Poker Players,’ an extract
from which I will read, as it bears so strongly
upon what I have said to you:</p>

<p>“‘... Never “pip” up in the pool when
you can avoid it—it is a useless drain upon one’s
money, and can always be avoided, thus: When
all are in but yourself, place your fore-finger firmly
upon a chip of the pool and exclaim, “Somebody
ain’t up!” “Pip up!” etc. This will of
<a name="png.35" id="png.35" href="#png.35"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>course compel any one who may be undecided
whether he “pipped up” to do so again; in
case he swears to it, or has proof, that he has
put up, then give in like a “lamb,” and put up a
chip—like a martyr.</p>

<p>“‘If you can manage to conceal four aces of
another pack in one of your boots or about
your person, and dexterously draw your hands
thence of course, do it; if caught, make it appear
a joke.</p>

<p>“‘If you have a bad hand quickly mingle it
with the pack, swear you had six cards and
draw your “ante,” or rather some one’s else, as
you did not put up. In this way you win one.</p>

<p>“‘If you have a good hand get mad, slam
down your cards, swear luck is against you, but
you’ll “go in a V, if you lose it,” just by way
of a “flyer.” Your opponent takes the bait,
and, thinking you are bluffing, goes a V better.
Now you’ve <em>got</em> him, go the V and an X better;
if he has a tolerable good hand he’ll see you and
“call.” Say at first, “a small pair.” If they
<a name="png.36" id="png.36" href="#png.36"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>36<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>are good take the pool without discovering what
else you may have; but if he has more than you
first, show your triplets or two pair, as the case
may be, and let all see it, that they may know
that you did not cheat them, at least.</p>

<p>“‘If you “go in one” and are called, say in a
very desponding tone while shuffling your cards,
with the pack, “Only a pair of aces,” as if you had
not the remotest idea of their being good,—but
it’s a pretty safe hand, and if your opponent
says they are good, take the pool; if not, then
examine his hand to see if he outholds you.</p>

<p>“‘Having had a pretty good run of luck and
finding it changing, draw your watch, swear
that you have an engagement at such a time,
which of course is now past; you are sorry, but
will have revenge another time, change in your
“chips,” pocket the “ready money,” and go on
a “bender.”’</p>

<p>“This bit of sarcasm well delineates the
methods of some players at this day.</p>

an experienced player. I’ll read it to you:</p>

<p>“‘Mr. Guggenheimer, Mr. Rosenbaum, Mr. Levi,
Mr. Cohen, and Mr. Einstein were engaged
in a little after-dinner game of “draw,”
at the residence of the former gentleman. The
host had occasion to leave the room for a short
time, and when he returned the cards had been
dealt for a new hand, and he was included, his
approaching footsteps being heard. Mr. Guggenheimer
raised the five cards allotted to him,
and could scarcely believe his eyes when four
kings were revealed. He inspected them carefully,
but the entire quartette of monarchs were
there.</p>

<p>“‘“Who doled these cards?” inquired Mr. Guggenheimer.
“Jakey Einstein,” replied Mr. Rosenbaum.</p>

<p>“‘Once more Mr. Guggenheimer gazed at the
tempting array, and not one of the kings had
got away. It was his turn to bet; he took a

><p>Finally, my boy, your Uncle
George must say that you stand a very poor
chance of holding your own, and no chance of
winning, if, in your party, there should be two
or three playing, who are ‘in together’; for
you play one hand against the best one of two
or three others, as the case may be. There are
many and ingenious ways in such cases of giving
each other information as to the value of
each other’s hands. From toe and knee knocking,
position of the fingers in holding the cards,
position of the cards when laid upon the table,
the use of a letter, syllable, word, or sentence;
the question you ask, and manner of asking; the
position of your segar or toothpick in your
mouth, etc., etc., etc. These parties have a sort
of a <i>telephono-graphosto</i> kind of information,
which, many times, it is impossible to detect.</p>
</div>

<p>“I will now try to picture to you a successful,
and yet <em>strictly honest, and liberal poker player</em>;
<a name="png.43" id="png.43" href="#png.43"><span class="pagenum"><span

than to play with others and <em>win</em>. You have
undoubtedly often heard this remark in your
club: ‘Well, there is no use in playing with
“Smithy,” for he always wins. I know he is a
square, nice man, a liberal player, and one of
the best fellows, socially, in the club; but we
can’t beat him, and yet we have to play with
him.’ Now, my boy; I will explain why this
is so; and I may say, the language of the Old

<p>“The fault is not in ‘Smithy,’ as you call him,
but in you yourselves, in not giving that attention
to the game that your friend ‘Smithy’
does. A good, honest, and successful poker
player is one who not only follows the rules of
the game—with such variation as circumstances
seem to require—but always has his eyes open,
his head clear, and knows all that is going on in
the party with whom he is playing. He sees
<a name="png.44" id="png.44" href="#png.44"><span class="pagenum"><span

 </span></span></a>and <em>remembers</em> their bets before they discard;
he never forgets the number of cards discarded,
and he soon learns their general style of playing;
the probabilities of their bluffing, etc., etc.
This gives him an advantage over all others
who are not so observing, and causes him many
times to ‘throw up’ a <em>very large hand</em>, instead
of ‘calling.’ He who says, ‘I know I am
beaten, but I will call on principle,’ as a rule
will be the loser. Therefore, by closely watching
the game, and remembering what takes
place, you will acquire that knowledge necessary
for success. Remember, my boy, in giving this
picture of a good poker player, your uncle does
not advise you to continue to play the game. He
only wishes to give you such instruction, should
you play, as will enable you not only to protect
yourself, but make you a stronger player—remembering
the old adage, that ‘Whatever is
worth doing at all, is worth doing well.’</p>

<p>“A very common error of an inexperienced
player, is to ‘start off’ in the game very rashly,
<a name="png.47" id="png.47" href="#png.47"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>‘going in’ on ‘ace high,’ or even drawing five
cards; and also of <em>crowding his bad luck</em> during
the game, and especially just before the
time for closing, in trying to ‘get hunk.’
This is all wrong, and will surely bring losses
and defeat. Play every hand, whether first or
last, as though it was your only hand, and with
all the care and coolness that I have mentioned
of a good player—or of your friend Smithy.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, dear uncle! I have been delighted
while listening to you. Of course I was aware
of some of the points you have given me;
still, the most are entirely new, instructive, and
amusing, and explain many things that until
now have been dark to me. They also prove
to me that there has been cheating in games in
which I have played, and explain how some
wonderfully large hands have been made—some
of which I did not feel satisfied with at
the time. Now, while your conversation is
fresh in my mind, if you will excuse me I will
go to my room and write out a set of rules for
<a name="png.48" id="png.48" href="#png.48"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>directing and governing the playing in our club,
which I know all the members will be pleased
with.”</p>

<p>“Well, I think no objection will be raised,
unless by those of the class I have named;
who, as I have said, are found in nearly every
club.</p>

<p>“Now having given you so much advice about
looking out for the wrongs and irregularities
of other players, I can not have you leave without
impressing something very important upon
your mind, namely: ‘<cite>Above all, watch yourself</cite>.’
It is an old saying that ‘one’s greatest enemy is
one’s own self.’ Under no circumstances, therefore,
remain in the game after midnight. All
players have a right, in accordance with the
rules of gaming, to leave off playing at midnight;
and no gentleman can object to it. Whether
you are ahead, therefore, or behind, <span class="allsc">QUIT WHEN
THE CLOCK STRIKES TWELVE</span>. By so doing, your
head will be clear and all right for business on
the morrow—remembering that there is another
<a name="png.49" id="png.49" href="#png.49"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>evening coming, for its share of recreation and
rational amusement.</p>

<div class="runin">
<h3 title="Finally">“<i>Finally.</i>—</h3
><p>I would advise you to quit the game
entirely. From what I have said, you must see
clearly that it has a great many more drawbacks
than advantages. It has cost your Uncle George
much money and time,—more than he ought to
have given it,—especially during his younger
years in the West and South. Nearly every
day’s paper has reports of ruined characters,
caused by enjoying ‘a little quiet game,’ or ‘a
little game of draw.’ It is impossible to keep
those who have a <em>predisposition to cheat</em> out of
the games, even of the most fashionable and
respectable class of players. Therefore, I say, it
would be better for you to quit it entirely.</p>
</div>

<p>“As I began by saying you must be sure and
<em>have the cards cut before the deal</em>, so I close by
saying you must be sure and see that <em>the dealer
gives no one more than his complement of cards</em>.
Some dealers are too much in the habit of
giving themselves six or more cards; this alone,
<a name="png.50" id="png.50" href="#png.50"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]
 </span></span></a>where all else is square, is a big per cent. ‘in
favor of the dealer.’</p>

<p>“If what your Uncle George has said to you
will be the means of saving you from becoming
the victim of those who ‘cheat at cards,’ or
save you from the sufferings and torments of
those others I have mentioned, growing out of
an undue attachment to the game of ‘Draw
Poker,’ or induce you to give it up entirely, he
will feel satisfied and happy.”</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
